          <br>
          I have worked for clients from a variety of industries, both as a freelancer and as part of a large digital agency. Previously, I trained as a scientist and I spent many years as a professional artist. I am used to navigating different worlds, and I am used to finding the right solution for the right context, within existing limitations and complexities.</p>

        <p class="body-small">
          I had the joy of working together with Flore on a couple of projects at AKQA. She is genuinely interested in understanding human value drivers and examining problems from multiple lenses, which is a fantastic trait to posses. Flore is the type of person you can always count on voicing her recommendation and challenging the process to make sure you end up with the best outcome possible. On top of that, she is a fantastic person!

          I have worked with Flore during her internship at GLOBHE. I was impressed with her curiosity, research skills, critical thinking, attitude to learning more, and overall UX skills. She was always asking relevant questions that made us rethink our design approach and as a result, we were able to better focus and improve our new UX designs. It was indeed very pleasant to work together with Flore.</p>

          I’ve met my fair share of decent UXers in my career, but Flore is one of the rarest breed of creative UX bringing a mixture of rigour and methodology, twinned with a creative mindset. She not only speaks the language of both disciplines but she’s a bridge between potential silos as well as great team player.</p>
